We're excited to announce that Crack the Code 2018 is going to take place in New York City on March 16th!

Last time, we focused on providing an introduction to the progressive data and analytics space for many newer practioners. This time, we're focusing on how to women and gender non-conforming people can personally and professional advance within the space. That means we're putting a bigger emphasis on managing up, down, and sideways; figuring out when it's the right time to move onto your next role; and pairing attendees with experts on resume and cover letter writing, negotiation, and more.

Right now, we're looking for your help! 

* If you live in New York City, can you host attendees of the event?
* If you live outside New York City, can you carpool with others?
* Are you interested in speaking about your experience or serving as an expert resource?
* Are you interested in helping us organize the event?

More details will appear on this site as we have them. In the meantime, drop us a line at [questions@crackthecode.io](mailto:questions@crackthecode.io).
