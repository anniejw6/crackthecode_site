We're excited to announce that Crack the Code 2018 is going to take place in New York City on Saturday March 17th!

Last time, we focused on providing an introduction to the progressive data and analytics space for many newer practioners. This time, we're focusing on how to women and gender non-conforming people can personally and professional advance within the space. That means we're putting a bigger emphasis on managing up, down, and sideways; figuring out when it's the right time to move onto your next role; and pairing attendees with experts on resume and cover letter writing, negotiation, and more.
