Crack the Code will be held in mid-March in New York City, and we're looking for speakers! 

#### Who are we looking for?

Women or gender non-conforming people who either currently or recently worked in progressive data, analytics, and technology! 

You might be ...

* an analyst, engineer, data manager, or another technical role
* a manager who worked with technical teams
* a business or sales-focused person who worked with technology
* a product manager
* a researcher

#### Themes and topics

We're looking for people who have solved cool projects in the last year or so to give short **lightning talks** (5-7 min explanations) of what they built and how they built it. You might want to talk about a new tool you're developing, a problem that you solved, a cool script you wrote, or a report that you built.

We're also looking for people who are more advanced in their careers to serve as "experts" for **one-on-one meetings** on topics such as resume reviews, interviewing, salary negotiations, and more.

We're also looking for folks to serve on **panels** about career progression and discovering your passion.

#### If you're interested, please email us at [speakers@crackthecode.io](mailto:speakers@crackthecode.io)

**Please note**: While we would love to accomodate everyone, we may not have time for everyone to be on the agenda!
