##### Who are we looking for?

Women or gender non-conforming people who either currently or recently worked in progressive data, analytics, and technology! **First time speakers are very welcome!**

You might be ...

* an analyst, engineer, data manager, or another technical role
* a manager who's worked with technical teams
* a business or sales-focused person who's worked with technology
* a product manager
* a researcher

##### Themes and topics

We're looking for people who have solved cool projects in the last year or so to give short **lightning talks** (5-7 min explanations) of what they built and how they built it. You might want to talk about a new tool you're developing, a problem that you solved, a cool script you wrote, or a report that you built. Past lightning talks have included: 

* How to Get Started Learning How to Code
* Using Geocodes to Match Precincts
* Staging Location Buddies: A Packet Redeployment Tool
* Data Salary Survey Results
* Innovative Testing on a Campaign Microsite

We're also looking for people who are more advanced in their careers to serve as "experts" for **one-on-one meetings** on topics such as resume reviews, interviewing, salary negotiations, and more.

We're also looking for folks to serve on **panels** on the following topics:

* Managing Up, Down, and Sideways
* Self-Care
* Best practices for learning technical skills on your own or on the job
* Things Managers do other than manage: Hiring, Firing, and Negotiating
* Career Planning: how to transition into new roles and how to know when to transition
