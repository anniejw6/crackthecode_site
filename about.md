###### **What are the goals of Crack the Code 2018?**

Crack the Code is a conference to promote the personal and professional 
growth of women and gender non-conforming people working in progressive data, analytics, and technology. Crack the Code is a trans-friendly space. Last time, we focused on providing an introduction to the progressive data and analytics space for newer practioners. This time, we're focusing on how people can personally and professional advance within the space. That means we're putting a bigger emphasis on managing up, down, and sideways; figuring out when it's the right time to move onto your next role; and pairing attendees with experts on resume and cover letter writing, negotiation, and more.

###### **Who's eligible to attend?**

We're inviting everyone who (1) works in data, analytics, or technology in progressive politics or plans on working in the field during 2018 or 2020 **AND** (2) is a woman or gender non-conforming person. Crack the Code is a trans-friendly space.

To elaborate on (1), we're looking for folks who have experience in politics and looking at to advance their careers. If you've never worked in politics or in political data, you're still welcome, but you might find some of the talks confusing.

To elaborate on (2), we fall into category #4 in [Kat March√°n's guide on inclusive spaces](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/on-the-design-of-womens-spaces-72bf8f396dc0).
