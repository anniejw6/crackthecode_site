###### **What are the goals of Crack the Code 2018?**

Crack the Code is a conference to promote the personal and professional 
growth of people working in progressive data, analytics, and technology who have lived gendered oppression in a significant way. Last time, we focused on 
providing an introduction to the progressive data and analytics space for newer practioners. This time, we're focusing on how people can personally and professional advance within the space. That means we're putting a bigger emphasis on managing up, down, and sideways; figuring out when it's the right time to move onto your next role; and pairing attendees with experts on resume and cover letter writing, negotiation, and more.

###### **Who's eligible to attend?**

We're inviting everyone who (1) works in data, analytics, or technology in progressive politics or plans on working in the field during 2018 or 2020 **AND** (2) has lived gendered oppression in a significant way.

To elaborate on (1), we're looking for folks who have experience in politics and looking at to advance their careers. If you've never worked in politics or in political data, you're still welcome, but you might find some of the talks confusing.

To elaborate on (2), we fall into category #4 in [Kat March√°n's excellent guide on inclusive spaces](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/on-the-design-of-womens-spaces-72bf8f396dc0). To borrow some language from [Mt. Holyoke](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/policies/admission-transgender-students#q2), we're open to folks who are

* Biologically born female; identifies as a woman
* Biologically born female; identifies as a man
* Biologically born female; identifies as other/they/ze
* Biologically born female; does not identify as either woman or man
* Biologically born male; identifies as woman
* Biologically born male; identifies as other/they/ze and when "other/they" identity includes woman
* Biologically born with both male and female anatomy (Intersex); identifies as a woman

But not folks who are

* Biologically born male; identifies as man
