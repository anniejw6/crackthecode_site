##### Soft Skills

###### Project Management

* [Asana](https://asana.com/) - Free task and project manager. Similar to JIRA but easier to set up; not quite the same level of detail as JIRA. People seem to be strongly pro or against Asana.
* [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) - Issue tracker. For under 10 users is about $200 a year; price scales up dramatically after that; Probably the most complicated of the options for setup but is great for both short term & long term once you are setup; Integrates with lots of things including hipchat & github
* [Trello](https://trello.com/) - free! Super easy to use, but does not necessarily have the level of detail some shops needs. Has far fewer integrations.
* [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) - There's a "Classic" and an updated basecamp - fairly straightforward to set up; cost money; is better for longer term projects (a week or more)
* [KanbanFlow](https://kanbanflow.com) - light-weight system that scales very well from a single person/independent contractor situation up to smallish teams; free to use, $5/month for premium features.
* [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)
