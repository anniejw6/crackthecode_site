We'll make the schedule based on your input when you [register](https://goo.gl/uVSVHh)!

We're potentially planning multiple tracks for managers and individual contributors, and we also hope to pair participants 1:1 with experts on topics like resumes, cover letters, interviewing, negotiating.

Potential talks include: 

* Managing Up, Down, and Sideways
* Self-Care
* Best practices for learning technical skills on your own or on the job
* Things Managers do other than manage: Hiring, Firing, and Negotiating
* Lightning Talks / Show & Tell: Share cool things you've built!
* Career Planning: how to transition into new roles and how to know when to transition
