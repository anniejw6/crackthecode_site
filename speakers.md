We're looking for speakers for lightning talks! Spend 5 minutes talking about a cool project you worked on this cycle.

Here are some potential ideas:

* I ran an experiment testing snapchat filters impact on turnout
* I took over and ran a data training program
* I learned SQL and built a new database for my org
* I negotiated a higher salary for myself using these tactics
* I learned ___ this year. Here's are the 5 things to watch out for.
* I built a model of ___. Here's how I did it.

No slides or code necessary -- just talk about something you found cool.

Register to speak below.
